# QUICKBYTES

QUICKBYTES is an All in One System. 

We wanted to build an app that automates as much of the restaurant experience as possible.  
This includes a way to manage a restaurant as well as order from it. 
It is built so that the program can be used by customers, employees, and managers.  
This requires the program to have a highly versatile interface with several different pages for each actor in the system. 
Each employee has an interface that interacts with the database, and can receive messages and alerts from other employees when necessary. 
The customer can log in to the same system, though they will have access to less things, they can still pay for their order online, view the menu, and call for service from their server.


Post-Covid Dining 

Restaurants have taken a beating during the pandemic as many small businesses and restaurants were closed for several months and still haven't fully recovered.
There is a lot that has changed and a lot that will need to be adapted.  
Delivery and Take Out has become incredibly important and we have made a way to fast track orders in the order queue for delivery and Take Out.  
We have also added a few features to limit interaction for the customer and employees.  
For instance, the Chef can send a message to a server through the program to ask questions about an order.  
The customer can push a button to call for service instead of flagging someone down. 
They can pay for their order online.  
The customer is also given the option to choose a contactless dining experience which means they will only see their server when they directly ask for them or when the food is brought out to them.

Easy All-Purpose Register 

One way that we wanted to make the program more accessible for everyone is by creating a single registry that will be used by both customers and employees.  
Everyone will make an account in the same way, though customers will have access to the customer interface, and the employees and managers will have their own individual interfaces relating to their specific job.  
This allows everyone to be connected through the single system so they can interact together seamlessly without having to jump around to multiple applications.
